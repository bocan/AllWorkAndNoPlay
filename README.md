# AllWorkAndNoPlay

An utterly pointless single line script that prints a message directly in the middle of your Linux console, then
writes the words of that message at random points on the console 10000 times.

A devops engineer asked if I wanted to help him write a line of code or two.  So I did.  Probably wasn't what he was
looking for.  ;-)

This will most likely only on Linux inside bash shells.  Unix operability may vary.
